# 3E33.nes
A Nintendo Entertainment System Emulator in Kotlin.

# Current State
I have decided to take a short break from this project because of lack of motivation.
Currently, very little amount progress is made:  
- The CPU is complete and fully tested with JSON tests.
- PPU supports basic background rendering.
